# 162E-Project

This repo contains the control system that was designed to stabilize our Senior Design Project, the Ballbot.  The Ballbot is a prototype for a novel transportation device - one that allows for omnidirectional motion of the platform by balancing on top of a ball.

The controls system accomplishes stability by simultaneously performing two PID control loops on different cross-sections of the robot.

The final design presentation which details the mechanical design as well as the controls design can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rGaBcjbj_4yFR1LjDntW5_rW1smjcrAp5dtDtqUXwmU/edit?usp=sharing).

A video of the ballbot in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8zjwEvJ8Qc).

This code is free for use.  Modify how you see fit.  As always, if there are any questions, please contact me and I will be happy to share further information.
